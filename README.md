# tic_tac_doey
Description:
This is a simple upgraded version of Tic Tac Toe with a twist build on Android Development using Java.  
It's pink right now, but will change it up to bring in animations using cartoon characters like Doey.  

Directions:
Player X chooses a "X" or "O" in a square and tries to get 3 in a row either vertical or horizontal.
It's really easy.
To restart game press button at the bottom that says "reset"
